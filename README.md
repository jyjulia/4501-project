Overview: 
This project utilizes NYC Open Data datasets and Zillow's historic monthly rent averages to assist in the search for a new apartment in New York City. The main criteria for selecting an ideal neighborhood include prioritizing a quiet environment and a significant presence of greenery. The project is implemented in a Jupyter notebook, combining data downloading, cleaning, storage, SQL queries, and visualizations.


Project Structure: 

The project is organized as follows

Data Collection and Cleaning:
Download relevant datasets from NYC Open Data and Zillow.
Perform data cleaning and preprocessing to ensure data quality.

Data Storage: 
Store the cleaned data in a structured format for easy retrieval and analysis.

SQL Queries: 
Define a set of SQL queries to extract meaningful insights from the stored data.
Example queries may include filtering neighborhoods based on noise complaints or identifying areas with high green space ratios.

Visualizations: 
Create visualizations using Python libraries (e.g., Matplotlib, Seaborn) to better understand the relationships between variables.
Visualize rent trends, noise complaints, and greenery levels across different neighborhoods.

Apartment Search Analysis:
Use the defined SQL queries and visualizations to analyze potential neighborhoods that align with your preferences.
Combine elements including rent averages, noise complaints, and greenery levels to identify suitable areas within budget constraints.


Instructions: 

Use the Jupyter Notebook:
pip install -r requirements.txt

Run the Jupyter Notebook:
Open the Jupyter notebook and execute each cell sequentially.

Interact with SQL Queries and Visualizations:
